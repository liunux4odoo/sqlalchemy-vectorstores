## Description
A vectorstore supports vector & bm25 search using sqlite or postgresql as backend through sqlalchemy.

## Features
- Do document CRUD
- Do vector search
- Do bm25 search
- ~~Customize tokenize for sqlite fts & postgres tsvector easily~~
- Filter results by metadata when search.
- Filter results by source tags when search. This is similar to collection of langchain-postgres, but can filter results across different tags.
- Use [simple fts tokenize](https://github.com/wangfenjin/simple) with sqlite.
- Same API to use Sqlite as embeded and using Postgres as server
- Support sync & async methods
- Minimal dependencies, all results are builtin List & Dict

## Install
```shell
# use sync sqlite
$ pip install sqlalchemy-vectorsotres[sqlite]

# use async sqlite
# $ pip install sqlalchemy-vectorsotres[asqlite]

# use postgres either sync or async
# $ pip install sqlalchemy-vectorsotres[postgres]
```
Please attention:
1. sqlite-vec 0.1.1 not work on windows, need to install `>=0.1.2.alpha9`
2. postgres use the `psycopg` driver, not `psycopg2`

## Usage
Here is an example using sync sqlite:
```python3
import openai
from sqlalchemy_vectorstores import SqliteDatabase, SqliteVectorStore
from sqlalchemy_vectorstores.tokenizers.jieba_tokenize import JiebaTokenize


DB_URL = "sqlite:///:memory:"
OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:9997/v1" # local xinference server
OPENAI_API_KEY = "E"
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "bge-large-zh-v1.5"


client = openai.Client(base_url=OPENAI_BASE_URL, api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
def embed_func(text: str) -> list[float]:
    return client.embeddings.create(
        input=text,
        model=EMBEDDING_MODEL,
    ).data[0].embedding

# Using sync sqlite database. you can use other 3 combinations.
db = SqliteDatabase(DB_URL, fts_tokenizers={"jieba": JiebaTokenize()}, echo=False)
vs = SqliteVectorStore(db, dim=1024, embedding_func=embed_func, fts_tokenize="jieba")


query = "Alaqua Cox"
sentences = [
    "Capri-Sun is a brand of juice concentrate–based drinks manufactured by the German company Wild and regional licensees.",
    "George V was King of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions, and Emperor of India, from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936.",
    "Alaqua Cox is a Native American (Menominee) actress.",
    "Shohei Ohtani is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher and designated hitter for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball.",
    "Tamarindo, also commonly known as agua de tamarindo, is a non-alcoholic beverage made of tamarind, sugar, and water.",
]


# add sources
src_id = vs.add_source(src="file1.pdf", tags=["a", "b"], metadata={"path": "path1"})

# add documents
for s in sentences:
    vs.add_document(src_id=src_id, content=s)

# search sources by src
r = vs.search_sources(vs.db.make_filter(vs.src_table.c.src, "file1.pdf"))
print(r)

# search sources by metadata
# vs.db_make_filter is a helper method to build sqlalchemy expressions.
r = vs.search_sources(vs.db.make_filter(vs.src_table.c.metadata, "path2", "dict", "$.path"))
print(r)

# search sources by tags
r = vs.get_sources_by_tags(tags_all=["b", "a"])
print(r)

r = vs.get_sources_by_tags(tags_any=["b", "a"])
print(r)

# upsert source with id - update
vs.upsert_source({"id": src_id, "metadata": {"path": "path1", "added": True}})
r = vs.get_source_by_id(src_id)
print(r)

# upsert source without id - insert
src_id3 = vs.upsert_source({"src": "file3.docx", "metadata": {"path": "path3", "added": True}})
r = vs.get_source_by_id(src_id3)
print(r)

# list documents of source file
print("list documents of source file")
r = vs.get_documents_of_source(src_id3)

# delete source and documents/tsvector/embeddings belongs to it.
r = vs.delete_source(src_id3)

# search by vector
r = vs.search_by_vector(query)
print(r)

# search by vector with filters
filters = [
    vs.db.make_filter(vs.src_table.c.src, "file1.pdf")
]
r = vs.search_by_vector(query, filters=filters)
print(r)

# search by bm25
r = vs.search_by_bm25(query)
print(r)
```

## Concepts
The vectorestore stores informations in 4 tables:
- All files from local disk or network are stored in a file source table with columns:
  - id, url, tags, metadata
- Splitted documents are stored in document table:
  - id, content, metadata. Same to langchain Document
  - type. Other documents besides documents loaded from source file such as summary, Q/A pairs, etc.
  - target_ids. The source documents which a typed document refs to.

- Cut Words are stored in FTS or TSVECTOR table
- Embeddings are stored in vector table

All functions are provided by 4 class pairs:
|              |Sqlite + Sqlite-vec + Sqlite-fts|Postgres + Pgvector  |
|--------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
|Sync|SqliteDatabase<br>SqliteVectorStore|PostgresDatabase<br>PostgresVectorStore|
|Async|AsyncSqliteDatabase<br>AsyncSqliteVectorStore|AsyncPostgresDatabase<br>AsyncPostgresVectorStore|

The `*Database` classes manage database initialization such as create tables, load extensions.
The `*VectorStore` classes manage document CRUD and search.

# Todo
- [x] add prebuilt sqlite fts tokenizer using jieba to support chinese bm25 search.
- [x] support customized tokenizer for postgres
- [ ] add common retrievers

## Changelog
### v0.1.4:
- feature:
  - Allow specify table names with a prefix in VectorStore
  - Add helper methods to drop all tables
  - Add helper methods to delete all documents by url
  - Add helper methods to read documents by metadata
- fix:
  - Avoid duplicate definitions of sqlalchemy.Table
  - Join tables correctly when source table empty
